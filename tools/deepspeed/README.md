DeepSpeed is a deep learning optimization library that makes distributed training efficient and effective with ease of use. This library is so powerful that a model scientist should have it in the arsenal.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros



### Cons

* DeepSpeed runs on top of PyTorch. 
  * If you use only TensorFlow or other machine learning frameworks, you have to learn PyTorch first.
  * PyTorch is easy to learn. If you can use a Python-based machine learning framework like TensorFlow, you can learn PyTorch faster.
