README

## TensorFlow version
TensorFlow2 is used.

## Quick start guide
Run either
  $ ./run
    or
  $ ./batch-run

## `run`
```bash
$ ./run
```
will create a sub-directory under the `logs` directory,
executes `batch-time_python_py_file`,
and extracts some sort of GPU performance measures.

## `batch-time_python_py_file`
`batch-time_python_py_file` is the key program which 
  runs the following source codes iteratively and
  logs the total run time, GPU utilization, and so on.

## List of executed source codes
1_mnist-mlp-keras.py
2_mnist-simple-cnn-keras.py
3_mnist-cnn-keras.py
4_fashion_mnist-cnn-keras.py
5_cifar10-cnn-keras-tf2.py
6_imdb_movie_review-bidirectional_lstm-keras.py
7_reuters_newswire-mlp-keras-tf2.py

## Caution: Do not run
5_cifar10-cnn-keras.py
7_reuters_newswire-mlp-keras.py

These source codes are kept for record. They are the old Keras code.
These codes are converted to TensorFlow2. Notice the difference between
  5_cifar10-cnn-keras.py     (for standalone Keras)
  5_cifar10-cnn-keras-tf2.py (for TensorFlow2)

`-tf2` is what we want because the code is ran by TensorFlow2.
