    "## Summary\n",
    "* 11,228 newswires from [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/) (with Keras API)\n",
    "  * The classic Reuters-21578 dataset have been parsed and preprocessed\n",
    "  * each newswire is encoded as a list of word indexes (integers)\n",
    "* labeled over 46 topics; 46 classes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common to text datasets\n",
    "* words are indexed by overall frequency in the dataset\n",
    "  * e.g. \"3\" encodes the 3rd most frequent word in the data\n",
    "  * \"0\" encodes any unknown word as a convention.\n",
    "  * This allows for quick filtering operations such as:\n",
    "    * only consider the top 10,000 most common words,\n",
    "    * but eliminate the top 20 most common words\n",
