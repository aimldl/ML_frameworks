# PyTorch

PyTorch is a deep learning framework that provides Tensors and Dynamic neural networks in Python. It is easier to use than TensorFlow and supports GPU acceleration easily. It is becoming so popular that PyTorch is becoming a de-facto standard for Academia over-dominating the stronghold of TensorFlow. It is primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab.

### PyTorch Domain Libraries

* torchvision
* torchtext
* torchaudio

> PyTorch domain libraries like torchvision, torchtext, and torchaudio provide convenient access to common datasets, models, and transforms that can be used to quickly create a state-of-the-art baseline. 

[New Releases: PyTorch 1.2, torchtext 0.4, torchaudio 0.3, and torchvision 0.4](https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-1.2-and-domain-api-release/), August 08, 2019, Team PyTorch.
